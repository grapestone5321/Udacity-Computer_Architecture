Pipelines, Caches, and MultiCores


This class is offered as CS6290 at Georgia Tech where it is a part of the Online Masters Degree (OMS). 

Taking this course here will not earn credit towards the OMS degree.

The course begins with a lesson on performance measurement, which leads to a discussion on the necessity of performance improvement.

Pipelining, the first level of performance refinement, is reviewed. The weaknesses of pipelining will be exposed and explored, and various solutions to these issues will be studied. 

The student will learn hardware, software, and compiler based solutions to these issues.
